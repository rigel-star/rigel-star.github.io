Hey there,

<div id="msg">

Hey dear, i'm on my late 19's now. I'm turning 20 next June. Let's say i'm adult now. I have done many mistakes in my life as a teenager. I have learnt so many things
as a boy, teenager and introvert. I'm writing this message to you hoping that you won't do the mistakes that I did. I'm you talking from your coming future.
  
  Life isn't as you planned when you were 15. Life is so much different right here. Don't be so shy. Talk to people if you have any questions. Don't built wall around 
  yourself. Get to know to many people as you can. Don't be anti social. Right now none of your friends talk to you who promised we will be together for ever.
  I mean it's not like that you don't have any friends. I just mean those who were fake are not in your life anymore. Choose your circle wisely man. Many will try to put 
  you down. Many people will hate you. And you will hate many too :).
  
  YOU ARE AMAZING. Please never compare yourself with others. You are you, don't try to be others.
