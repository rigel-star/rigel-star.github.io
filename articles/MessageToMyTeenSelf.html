Hey there,

<div id="msg">

I'm on my late 19's now. I'm turning 20 next June. Let's say i'm adult now. I have done many mistakes in my life as a teenager. I have learnt so many things
as a boy, teenager and introvert. I'm writing this message to you hoping that you won't do the mistakes that I did. I'm you talking from your coming future.
